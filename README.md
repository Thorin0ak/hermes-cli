# HERMES-CLI

A simple CLI tool to publish events to a Mercure Hub, and optionally also subscribe to receive them.

# ⚡️ Getting started

Download the binaries corresponding to your OS [here](https://github.com/Thorin0ak/hermes-cli/releases).

Provide a Yaml file containing the different Mercure configurations per environment you wish to interact with. The
project comes with a [sample config file](https://github.com/Thorin0ak/hermes-cli/blob/main/sample-config.json):

```yaml
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "localhost",
      "url": "https://localhost/.well-known",
      "jwtSecretKey": "!ChangeMe!"
    }
  ]
}
```

- [ ] publish binaries to allow installation with `brew`
- [ ] encrypt secrets
- [ ] generate different types of mock payload
- [ ] `sub` should be randomly generated, to ensure no collisions
